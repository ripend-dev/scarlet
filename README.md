# SCARLET
A next-generation lua script for "Word Bomb" on roblox

# what this script currenttly supports:
* pretty much nothing...

# what this script aims to support in the near future:
* amazing autotyping
* best word suggestions
* support for all gamemodes and generations
* extremely customizable human-like autotyping
* supporting learning new words
* many sorting algorithms
* ...and more!

This script is currently in a very early version and is still being worked on a lot, so expect a lot of changes. The script supports the current version of Word Bomb as of 01/10/2025, but will be updated when Word Bomb 3.0 will be released. After Word Bomb 2 is released to the public, this script will be archived and a new one will be made to support the new game's systems, with support for the new ranked competitve matchmaking and so much more, meaning that the script will actually be useful for something.

Feel free to do anything you want with this script.
