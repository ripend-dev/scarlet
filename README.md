# SCARLET
A next-generation lua script for "Word Bomb" on roblox. This script should work with almost all executors, but it doesn't support mobile as of right now!

### what this script currently supports:
* human-like autotyping
* word suggestions

### what this script aims to support in the near future:
* better autotyping
* best word suggestions
* support for all gamemodes and generations
* supporting learning new words
* many sorting algorithms
* support for other generations and gamemodes
* ...and more!

This script is currently in a very early version and is still being worked on a lot, so expect a lot of changes. The script supports the current version of Word Bomb as of 01/10/2025, but will be updated when Word Bomb 3.0 will be released. After Word Bomb 2 is released to the public, this script will be archived and a new one will be made to support the new game's systems, with support for the new ranked competitve matchmaking and so much more, meaning that the script will actually be useful for something.

Feel free to do anything you want with this script.
